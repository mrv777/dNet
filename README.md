## Image Recommendation

You can easily integrate images into your HTML file using base64.

- First compress the image as much as possible using something such as https://compressjpeg.com/
- Encode the image as Base 64 (https://www.base64-image.de/)
- Insert your IMG tag with the Base 64 encoding (`<img src="RESULTS OF BASE 64 ENCODING" alt="alias" />`)
